                <h3>Monaco</h3>
                <p>The reason I chose Monaco as a dream destination it's because of the reputation it has and it is one of the most iconic cities around the world. It also has beautiful scenery of the deep blue sea, graceful palm trees and vibrant flowers. It's just a perfect destination. Monaco is also known as a "Billionaires' Playground". The city is famous for its lavish wealth, casinos, and glamorous events such as the Monaco Yacht Show and the Monaco Grand Prix. Monaco claims to be one of the most high-security cities in the world, with a 24-hour video surveillance system that covers the entire town, therefore safety is guaranteed.</p>

                <h2>A foreign language</h2>
                <p>I would like to learn French language. The reason being it is the official language in France. France is one of the countries that I would like to visit and actually learn more about their culture and history. The is 29 countries in African where French is spoken, so it will also help me to interact with my fellow African brothers.</p>
